# PasswordStealer

Simple software that steals [chrome, ...] browser passwords and sends them to you by email. 
It is a cross-platform solution and is not detected by [antivirus](#virustotal) ðŸ¤”

The project was created **for educational** purposes.  
I am not responsible for any of your actions!


## How to build

Before building, do not forget to create a config.txt file 
using the [template](config.txt.example)

Since the data from config.txt is sewn into the program, 
each unique config creates a unique build and, 
accordingly, a unique hash

### dependencies

The only external dependency is curl

## How to use

After compile, you receive an executable file. 
It is completely ready to use.
